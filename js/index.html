      <div class="content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Covid-19 pandemic began around 2020 and is still currently ongoing
          till this very day. It is safe to say that covid has impacted the lives 
          of almost every single person on the planet, in more than one way. The 
          aim of this visualization is to anaylze and identify trends and patterns
          of Covid-19 up to the present day. 
        </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Total Covid-19 Cases In Every country</h2>
          <div class="vis-container" id="vis1"></div>
          <p>
            The total number of cases in each country is represented using this 
            choropleth map. The darker coloured areas on the map represents countries
            in the world where there high numbers of cases of COVID-19. On the other
            hand, lighter coloured areas on the map indicate lower number of cases
            in that particular country. A filter to obtain a specific range of 
            population was also included at the bottom left of the graph.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Number of Confirmed Cases vs Number of Deaths</h2>
          <div class="vis-container" id="vis2"></div>
          <p>
            From the bubbleplot, we can observe that there is a positive correlation
            between the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the total number 
            of deaths. Countries like the United States, India, and Brazil all have
            a very high number of deaths and number of confirmed cases. This might 
            also be due to the vast population that each of these countries have. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Total Number of Vaccinations In Each Country</h2>
          <div class="vis-container" id="vis3"></div>
          <p>
            As indicated by the map figure, the total number of vaccinations in every
            country is represented by a circular mark, and varies in size according
            to the number of vaccinations in that particular country. We can observe 
            that India has the highest number of vaccinations, and this might be 
            because the fact that they have a large population of citizens.
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Negative Impacts of COVID-19</h2>
          <div class="vis-container" id="vis4"></div>
          <p>
            As shown in the pie-chart, these are 4 examples of how COVID-19 has 
            negatively impacted the people all around the world. It can be seen that 
            COVID-19 has caused many people to be extreme poverty due to the loss of
            jobs. The pandemic has also caused people to have more health diseases
            such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The last factor, smoking, 
            might have been used as a coping mechanism for many stressed individuals, 
            causing the number of smokers to rise all around the world.
