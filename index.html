      <div class="description">
        <p style="margin: 0px">
          The <strong><span style="color: #ff0d00">Covid-19</span></strong> pandemic began around 2020 
          and it is still currently ongoing up till this very day. It is safe to say that 
          covid has impacted the lives of almost every single person on the planet, in 
          one way or another. The aim of this visualization is to <strong>anaylze and identify
          </strong> trends and patterns of <strong><span style="color: #ff0d00">Covid-19</span></strong> up 
          to the present day.

          <div class="visualization" id="vis1"></div>
          <p>
            The total number of cases in each country is represented using this 
            choropleth map. The <strong>darker coloured areas</strong> on the map represents countries
            in the world where there are <strong>high numbers of cases</strong> of <strong><span style="color: #ff0d00">Covid-19</span></strong>. 
            On the other hand, <strong>lighter coloured areas</strong> on the map indicate <strong>lower number of cases</strong>
            in that particular country. A <span style="color: #97514d">filter</span> to obtain a specific range of population was also 
            included at the bottom left of the graph.

          <div class="visualization" id="vis2"></div>
          <p>
            The <strong>Top 10</strong> countries with the most <strong><span style="color: #ff0d00">Covid-19</span></strong> cases are shown in the above
            bar chart. According to the chart above, the <strong><span style="color: #0e25f1">United States</span></strong> has the highest
            number of <strong><span style="color: #ff0d00">Covid-19</span></strong> Cases. It can be also be noted that most of the countries
            in the top 10 come from the <strong><span style="color: #520288">American</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #af50db">European</span></strong> region, with only 2 
            countries coming from the <strong><span style="color: #206305">Asian</span></strong> region. This can be due to the fact that 
            the countries in the <strong><span style="color: #520288">American</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #af50db">European</span></strong> regions generally have a <strong>higher population</strong> than the countries in the Asian region.

          <h2>Number of Confirmed Cases vs Number of Deaths</h2>
          <div class="visualization" id="vis3"></div>
          <p>
            From the bubbleplot, we can observe that there is a <strong>positive correlation</strong>
            between the number of confirmed <strong><span style="color: #ff0d00">Covid-19</span></strong> cases and the total number 
            of deaths. Countries like the <strong><span style="color: #0e25f1">United States</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #348f1d">India</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color: #3f0b14">Brazil</span></strong> all have
            a <strong><span style="color: #f10ede">very high</span></strong> number of deaths and number of confirmed cases. This might also be due to the vast population that each of these countries have.

          <h2>Total Number of Vaccinations In Each Country</h2>
          <div class="visualization" id="vis4"></div>
          <p>
            As indicated by the map figure, the <strong>total number of <span style="color: #875ed4">vaccinations</span></strong>in every
            country is represented by a circular mark, and varies in size according
            to the number of vaccinations in that particular country. We can observe 
            that <strong><span style="color: #348f1d">India</span></strong> has the highest number of vaccinations, and this might be 
            because the fact that they have a <strong>large population</strong> of citizens.

          <h2>Relationship between <span style="color: #f16e67">Covid-19</span> Cases and Vaccinations</h2>
          <div class="visualization" id="vis5"></div>
          <p>
            As shown by the scatterplot above, it can be seen that there is a <strong>positive correlation</strong> between the number 
            of <strong><span style="color: #ff0d00">Covid-19</span></strong> cases and the total number of 
            vaccinations in a country. This makes sense because as the virus spreads
            and cases rises, more of the general population would feel the need to
            obtain their vaccinations to <strong><span style="color: #b87209">safeguard</span> themselves from the virus</strong>.

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Negative Impacts of <span style="color: #f16e67">Covid-19</span></h2>
          <div class="visualization" id="vis6"></div>
          <p>
            As shown in the pie-chart, these are 4 examples of how <strong><span style="color: #ff0d00">Covid-19</span></strong> has 
            negatively impacted the people all around the world. It can be seen that 
            <strong><span style="color: #ff0d00">Covid-19</span></strong> has caused many people to be in <strong><span style="color: #355ba1">extreme poverty</span></strong> 
            due to the loss of jobs. The pandemic has also caused people to have more health diseases
            such as <strong><span style="color: #b832b1">cardiovascular diseases</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #21ac34">diabetes</span></strong>. 
            The last factor, <strong><span style="color: #ff7b00">smoking</span></strong>, might have been used as a coping mechanism for many stressed individuals, 
            causing the number of smokers to rise all around the world.
